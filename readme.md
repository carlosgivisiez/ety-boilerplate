# Introduction

This is a minimal boilerplate for a Restful API. There is no restrictions on your project structure neither on the packages you choose to remove. All configurations files are on the root, and some packages setups are defined inside `package.json`.

With this project you have scripts, building, testing, validation, dependency injection, logger, decorator, dotenv, linting and pre-commit hook. Everything configurated so you can start coding.
